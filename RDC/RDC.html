        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Our scope of work has led us to work for small community based organizations as well as for national organizations, regional bodies, pan-african organizations, and international bodies. Based on its experience, a dedicated team in RDC spearheads each assignment.
           This comprises designing the methodologies, frameworks, work plans, curriculum and tersm of reference or any other needed designs to make the effective. Through its network of collaborators, associates and contacts it identifies the best sources of primary and secondary data and information that is relevant for the work.
            RDC identifies collaborators who have a potential to take part in resourse and development for identified needs. The output of this process provides a solid foundation for qualitative assessment and analysis of issues. In addition, we have about five key professionals within each country we work. Our fine blend of expertise from the UN, World Bank, NGO, Private and Public Sector puts us ahead of the rest.
          
          </p>
          <p> RDC is continuously involved in sub-regional and regional client activities. This brings together professionals in the NGO sector from the Southern and Eastern, the Horn and Great Lakes Regions of Africa. 
            In addition to the key areas cited, we provide profesional trainers, moderators, facilitators, reporters and interpreters to local, regional and interantional meetings, workshops, seminars, discussions, consultations and conferences. 
            This service includes the capacity to put together all the logistical requirements, coordination, administrative, public relations, media representation, reporting and management support.</p>

            <p>Our strength has been working in teams. The team spearheads the process and is responsible for carrying out the activities scheduled in the terms of reference and work plan for each assignment.
               At field or client level, the team works in partnership with the local people or the clients' personnel selected from within.
               The selection is usually based on the partners' understanding of the context and practical experience in the relevant activities.
              </p>
              <p>The network we have represents nearly all sectors in development work. 
                Each activity is alawys assigned at least two persons. Our associate resource persons have expertise and experience borne of practical work as full-time practitioners before becoming consultants.
                 They have handled assignments at grassroots level, national  regional and international level.
                This also applies to our communnications, research and community work, which are sectors we have adequate human resource and experience.
